  -- Algorithm for assigning rules to phases for a given period
  -- (assuming they aren't given an exact phase):

    -- 1. List the rules by their offsets, highest first.

    -- 2. If the list is empty, stop.

    -- 3. Otherwise, take the head of the list and assign its phase as follows:
    -- find the set of phases containing the minimum number of rules such that
    -- they are at least as large as the rule's offset.  Then take the smallest
    -- of those phases.

    -- 4. Go to (2).

  -- Algorithm properties: for each period,

    -- A. Each rule is scheduled no earlier than its offset.

    -- B. The phase with the most rules is the minimum of all possible schedules
    -- that satisfy (A).

    -- XXX Check if this is true.
    -- C. The sum of the difference between between each rule's offset and it's
    -- scheduled phase is the minimum of all schedules satisfying (A) and (B).
